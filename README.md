# Quadratic-Log-Log-Dependence

In many real-life situations ranging from financial to volcanic data,
growth is described either by a power law -- which is linear in log-log scale, or by
a quadratic dependence in the log-log scale. In this paper, we use natural scale invariance
requirement to explain the ubiquity of such dependencies. We also explain what should be a
reasonable choice of the next model, if quadratic turns out to be not too accurate: it turns out that
under scale invariance, the next class of models are cubic dependencies in the log-log scale, then
fourth order dependencies, etc.
